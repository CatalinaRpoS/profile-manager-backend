Here, you'll fin the API for a web application designed and developed to find and manage easily the corportate profile of workers in the company. A dummy profile was added for test purposes.

## Requirements

This project was dockerized so you can use it easily. You need to install the following tools:

- Docker.
- Docker compose (optional).

First, you need to make a copy of the repository on your local machine using the following commands in a console like `cmd` or `bash`.

    git clone https://github.com/CatalinaRpoS/profile-manager-backend
    cd profile-manager-backend
    ```

2. **Without Docker Compose:**

If you haven't installed Docker Compose, you must perform the following steps:

- Create an `.env` file in the project with the same information you can find in the `.env.example` file that there's in the repository.
